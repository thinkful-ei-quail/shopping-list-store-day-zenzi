1. React, just loads the whole react project into an html element which has root id by default.
2. Class component, needs to have a render() function which actually renders its template (HTML markup)
3. Class markup needs to be enclosed into one tag, if you have nothing, you can use: <> </>
4. You can break one  template into multiple components so that you can reuse  them.
5. You pass data from parent component to the child component using props
6. When you change a state variable, it rerenders the components which use the same state variable
7. You always update a state using setState function8. You handle the events using event handlers, for example clicking of a button is handled by 
an event handler called: onClick
